# Design Goals

Our primary design goals for the code jam project were:

- **Browser-first:** The application should run entirely in the browser, using technologies like PyScript and Pyodide and
  leveraging the browser APIs where possible.
- **Python-centric:** The project should be developed mainly in Python, minimizing reliance on other languages.
- **Modern web architecture:** The app’s structure should follow typical web application patterns, allowing us to assess
  Python’s suitability for building modern web apps.
- **Mobile-friendly:** The application should provide a seamless experience on mobile devices, similar to an authentic Pokédex.

As the project progressed, we aimed to add **offline capability** as a key feature. However, this goal was only partially
achieved, as some components ultimately did not run in the browser.
